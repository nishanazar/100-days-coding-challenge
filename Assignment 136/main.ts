// Demonstrates using console.log()inside a loop to track variable values

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i ++){
    console.log(`Iteration ${i}, i value:, i`);// logs the current iteration number and the value of i   
}
// this loop iterates five times, logging the value of 'i' during each iteration to help with debugging.
